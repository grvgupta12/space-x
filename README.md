This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.0.0.

## About this project

This website is designed with a "Mobile-first" approach and I have used Bootstrap for providing responsiveness. Its a responsive website supporting mobile, tablet and desktop views.
I have used Angular Universal in this application for Server Side Rendering and all the build configurations are written in package.json file.
I have created seperate components "side bar" and "main component" and placed both the components inside the home component. I have set the filter values as parameters on the route and fetch the filter parmeters from the route and called the api based on the filters provided.
